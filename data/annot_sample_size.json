The study extends previous knowledge that showed that support for motivational support in class is related to students' intrinsic motivation as it focused on the developmental changes of a set of different motivational variables and the relations of these changes to student-perceived motivational support in class. Thus, differential classroom effects on students' motivational development were investigated. A sample of 1088 German students was assessed in the beginning of the school year when students were in grade 8 (Mean age = 13.70, SD = 0.53, 54% girls) and again at the end of the next school year when students were in grade 9. Results of latent change models showed a tendency toward decline in mastery goal orientation and a significant decrease in academic effort from grade 8 to 9. Intrinsic motivation did not decrease significantly across time. Student-perceived support of competence in class predicted the level and change in students' academic effort. The findings emphasized that it is beneficial to create classroom learning environments that enhance students' perceptions of competence in class when aiming to enhance students' academic effort in secondary school classrooms.",

Students' taskspecific self-efficacy was the only motivation variable to predict performance and did so both at start and end of year. There were no differences in anxiety, selfconcept, or self-efficacy for self-regulation between start and end of year, but, by end of year, students described mathematics as less valuable and reported lower effort and persistence. Gifted students had stronger mathematics self-concept beliefs, and they had more accurate and less overconfident self-efficacy beliefs than did regular education students.

Latent structural modeling analysis revealed that a mastery climate predicted higher levels of perceived academic competence perceived in the first year of middle school, although attachment security to the mother in Grade 6 predicted perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms in the first year of middle school. A moderating effect was found, in which greater attachment security to the mother appeared to lessen the relationship between a performance climate and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition. Conclusion. -The results suggest that attachment security to the mother predicts perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition. Additionally, attachment security to the mother can moderate the potentially harmful effects of a learning climate emphasizing social comparison and performance on anxiety.",

Data from 475 students in 11 th and 12 th grade (girls: 50.3%; 31 classrooms; 12 schools), who participated in two waves of the study, were analyzed. Results of longitudinal structural equation models demonstrated that students' perceptions of their parents' mathematics value beliefs at Time 1 affected the students' own mathematics utility value at Time 2. Bidirectional effects were not shown in the full sample but were identified for boys. The paths within the tested model varied for boys and girls. For example, boys', not girls', mathematics intrinsic value predicted their reported conversations with their fathers about future occupational plans. Boys', not girls', perceived parents' mathematics value predicted the mathematics utility value. Findings are discussed in relation to their implications for parents and teachers, as well as in relation to gendered motivational processes.",

Self-esteem was assessed annually from age 12 to 16, and depression was assessed at age 16 and 35. Results from latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that both level and change in self-esteem served as predictors for adult depression. Individuals who entered adolescence with low self-esteem, and/or whose selfesteem declined further during the adolescent years, were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression 2 decades later as adults; this pattern held both for global and domain-specific self-esteem.

The results are interpreted in terms of differential emphasizing of sources of information for students' self-concept construction.

To secure stable and valid selfassessments, students emphasized other sources than grades; in this, case information obtained through parental competence appraisals.

However, how they change and how they relate to each other and to academic achievement across early schooling years remain open to question Aims. This 3-year longitudinal study was aimed at examining the following questions. Do children's perceived competence and intrinsic motivation about reading and mathematics change across the first 3 years of schooling? Do their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation differ according to academic domains? Do their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation relate to their academic achievement in each academic domain? Sample. A total of 115 elementary schoolchildren (63 boys and 52 girls) were examined in first grade (mean age = 84,5 months, SD = .67) and for the next 2 years.Children responded to questionnaires about their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation in reading and mathematics. Year-end grades in these two subjects were used as a measure of performance. Results. Changes in perceived competence and intrinsic motivation, and between-year intercorrelations, were observed to differ according to academic domains and gender. Intrinsic motivation did not make a significant contribution to academic achievement at either school grade or in any academic domain, whereas perceived competence was significantly related to achievement at each school grade in both reading and mathematics. Conclusions. Differences between boys and girls observed in this study were not linked to a specific domain and cannot be attributed to gender-role stereotypes. Girls www.bps.org.uk",

The average growth trajectories of school compliance, participation in extracurricular activities, school identification, and subjective valuing of learning decreased from 7th to 11th grades (mean ages = 12.9 years to 17.2 years). Different sources of social support were not equally important in their impact on school engagement, and the effect of these sources differed by the aspect of engagement studied.

Surveys were given to 341 students in the fifth grade in elementary and again in sixth grade in middle school. Students were more oriented to task goals (wanting to improve their competency), perceived a greater emphasis on task goals during instruction, and felt more academically competent in fifth grade in elementary school than in sixth grade in middle school. They perceived a greater emphasis on performance goals (an emphasis on relative ability and right answers) in middle school than in elementary school. Several interactions emerged between year (fifth grade, sixth grade), and both student level of ability (higher, lower, based on standardized achievement tests) and subject domain (math, English). \u1b67 1997Studies suggest that the transition to middle level schools is associated with a decline in motivation and performance for a number of children (see Eccles & Midgley, 1989, for a review). The assumption is sometimes made that these declines are related to physiological and psychological changes associated with puberty and are inevitable. Eccles and Midgley (1989) challenged that assumption, demonstrating that differences in the classroom environment before and after the transition were related to declines in students' expectancies and values in mathematics (e.g., Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, The research reported in this article was supported by grants from the US Department of Education (R215A00430, R117C80003).

Results revealed that body objectification decreased, self-esteem increased, and depressive symptoms remained relatively steady across adolescence.

Method: We used a large German sample (N 5 6,010; 53.2% females; baseline M age 5 14.1) with two measurement points over a period of 5 months (middle and end of 7th grade). Estimating LOESS curves and latent change-regression models revealed three main findings. Results: (a) Optimism showed a nonlinear association with subsequent changes in academic achievement: Optimism promoted academic achievement, but this positive association reached a plateau in above-average optimism ranges and a minimum value in below-average ranges of optimism. (b) The achievement level at t 1 moderated this relation so that high optimism exerted a more positive effect for high-achieving adolescents. (c) By contrast, optimism had an overall positive effect on self-esteem.The results therefore broaden the evidence on benefits of optimism by linking optimism to academic success in early adolescents but indicate only small and nonlinear associations.",

One approach to these issues has been to examine the relations between motivation and cognition over time. In addition, it is likely that students perceptions of the classroom context may play a role in facilitating effective learning. The current study examines these issues from a goal orientation theory perspective using a sample of middle school students (n = 306). Data on students' personal motivational beliefs and cognitive strategy use as well as perceptions of the classroom goal structures were gathered using surveys. A longitudinal design was used to examine the research questions. Results suggest that motivation and cognition are reciprocally related over time. In addition, perceptions of classroom context were found to have an explanatory effect over and above the variance explained by prior measures of motivation and cognition. The implications for this work include the notion that student motivation can be enhanced through instruction in cognitive strategy use as well as through alteration of classroom goal structures so that there is a stronger emphasis on tasks and learning rather than on grades or external recognition.
